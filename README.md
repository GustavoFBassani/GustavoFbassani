## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a software development student focused on the Swift programming language, used to create amazing apps for the Apple ecosystem, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the fundamentals of Swift, including concepts like control flow, collection handling, object-oriented programming, and SwiftUI for building elegant and responsive user interfaces.

ðŸ”­ I'm working on projects to practice my skills, such as small apps that solve everyday problems and explore the possibilities of mobile development.
